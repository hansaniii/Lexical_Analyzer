# Lexical_Analyzer
Lexical Analyzer with Flask API

This project implements a lexical analyzer using Python and Flask. The lexical analyzer reads a given string (source code) and breaks it down into a list of tokens based on predefined rules such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and more. This tool can be used for basic code analysis and tokenization, useful in building compilers or interpreters.

Features:
Tokenizes keywords, identifiers, numbers, string literals, and operators.
Supports single-line and multi-line comments.
Provides an API to submit a string and receive the tokenized output in JSON format.
Handles common programming language syntax such as parentheses, braces, semicolons, and more.
